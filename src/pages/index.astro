Anyone can sign up, find a verified sitter or dog walker, and book — all within the platform. Payments and communication happen in one place. Service providers go through identity verification before their first booking. We also built for the broader community. Pet-friendly places across Romania, public adoption listings, and resources for pet owners who need more than just a sitter.",

The agent says it's finished. It isn't.",

            content: "Minio is a Rust CLI that orchestrates Claude Code agents through development plans. It spawns agents as minions, assigns them tasks, and verifies they actually completed the work. A 4-layer gate catches rationalization: artifact checks confirm expected files exist, an LLM evaluator detects corner-cutting, Claude Code hooks block premature exits, and a circuit breaker stops infinite loops. Agents are defined as simple markdown files — researcher, developer, tester, reviewer — or any custom role you need.",

If a task fails the gate, it gets sent back with review notes. Ctrl+C saves state; minio resume picks up where you left off. Open source on GitHub.",
