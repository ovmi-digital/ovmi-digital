        content: "We revamped Lola from the ground up — keeping what worked, replacing what didn't. No more invite gates. Anyone can sign up, find a verified sitter or dog walker, and book — all within the platform. Payments and communication happen in one place. Service providers go through identity verification before their first booking. We also built for the broader community. Pet-friendly places across Romania, public adoption listings, and resources for pet owners who need more than just a sitter.",

        label: "Where it's going",
