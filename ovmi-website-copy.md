## About

Ovmi is a small studio based in Europe.

We've spent over a decade building software, shipping products, and working at the edge of what technology can do — from blockchain infrastructure to full-stack applications. When AI changed everything, we didn't pivot. We doubled down.

Today our team is a mix of engineers, designers, and AI agents working together on the same problems. We build our own products. We take on select client work. We care about craft.

Small by choice. Serious by default.

## What We Do

Most clients come to us with an idea or a problem. We help figure out the rest.

We work across the full stack — web, mobile, design, automation, blockchain, and AI. Not as separate services. As one connected capability.

**Product development**
Web and mobile applications, built to last.

**AI integration & automation**
We embed AI into products and workflows. From simple automations to full agent systems.

**AI consultation**
Not sure where AI fits in your business? We'll help you find out — and build a plan that makes sense.

**Design**
Interfaces that work. Aesthetics that hold up.

**Blockchain development**
When the project calls for it, we know how to build it right.

## How We Work

Every project starts with a conversation. No forms, no briefs — just a discussion about your idea, your problem, and where you want to go.

From there, we do our own research. We dig into the space, understand the real pain points, and come back with a clear perspective on what's worth building.

Then we decide together. Features, scope, priorities — nothing gets built without alignment.

Through development we keep you close. Early versions, feedback loops, real conversations. No surprises at the finish line.

We help you test, release, and get to market. Then we step back — unless you need us to stay.

## Case Studies

### Lola.pet
*Pet sitting, done right.*

**The project**

We bought the domain for two reasons. It was perfect. And one of us has a Labrador named Lola.

The platform existed. The idea was solid. But the product needed to grow up.

**What we built**

We revamped Lola from the ground up — keeping what worked, replacing what didn't.

No more invite gates. Anyone can sign up, find a verified sitter or dog walker, and book — all within the platform. Payments and communication happen in one place. Service providers go through identity verification before their first booking.

We also built for the broader community. Pet-friendly places across Romania, public adoption listings, and resources for pet owners who need more than just a sitter.

**Where it's going**

Lola launches in Romania this year. 500+ people already on the waitlist.

This is what we do — we find the right idea, build it properly, and ship it.
